# officeGraphInsights resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Insights are relationships calculated using advanced analytics and machine learning techniques. You can, for example, identify OneDrive documents trending around users.

Insights are returned by the following APIs:

- [Trending](insights-trending.md) - returns documents from OneDrive and from SharePoint sites trending around a user.
- [Used](insights-used.md) - returns documents viewed and modified by a user. Includes documents the user used in OneDrive for Business, SharePoint, opened as email attachments, and as link attachments from sources like Box, DropBox and Google Drive.
- [Shared](insights-shared.md) - returns documents shared with a user. Documents can be shared as email attachments or as OneDrive for Business links sent in emails.

Each insight is returned with a `resourceVisualization` and `resourceReference` complex value type (CVT). The resourceVisualization CVT contains properties such as `title` and `previewImageUrl`. Microsoft uses the visualization properties to render the files in experiences like Office Delve.
