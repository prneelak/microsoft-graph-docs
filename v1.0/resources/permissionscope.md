# permissionScope resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents an OAuth 2.0 delegated permission scope. The specified OAuth 2.0 delegated permission scopes may be requested by client applications (through the **requiredResourceAccess** collection on the [application](application.md) object) when calling a resource application. The **oauth2Permissions** property <!-- of the [servicePrincipal](serviceprincipal.md) entity and --> of the [Application](application.md) entity is a collection of **permissionScope**.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|adminConsentDescription|String| Permission help text that appears in the admin consent and app assignment experiences. |
|adminConsentDisplayName|String| Display name for the permission that appears in the admin consent and app assignment experiences. |
|id|Guid| Unique scope permission identifier inside the oauth2Permissions collection. |
|isEnabled|Boolean| When creating or updating a permission, this property must be set to **true** (which is the default). To delete a permission, this property must first be set to **false**. At that point, in a subsequent call, the permission may be removed. |
|origin|String| For internal use. |
|type|String| Specifies whether this scope permission can be consented to by an end user, or whether it is a tenant-wide permission that must be consented to by a company administrator. Possible values are *User* or *Admin*. |
|userConsentDescription|String| Permission help text that appears in the end-user consent experience. |
|userConsentDisplayName|String| Display name for the permission that appears in the end-user consent experience. |
|value|String| The value of the scope claim that the resource application should expect in the OAuth 2.0 access token. |
