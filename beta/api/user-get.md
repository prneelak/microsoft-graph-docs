# Get a user

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the properties and relationships of user object.

This operation returns by default only a subset of the more commonly used properties for each user. These _default_ properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/user.md#properties) section. To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET operation](user-get.md) for the user and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option. Because the **user** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can also use the `GET` operation to get custom properties and extension data in a **user** instance.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | User.Read, User.ReadWrite    |
|Application | User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and [user](../resources/user.md) object in the response body.

This method returns `202 Accepted` when the request has been processed successfully but the server requires more time to complete related background operations.
